How to learn languages? Practice, is the short answer to that question. 

But where do I start to practice, you might ask? Where can I find courses or meeting points or tutorials that I can trust?

This is what I hope I can help you with. I have included summaries of the best places to learn languages as well as links to the material. Happy learning!
